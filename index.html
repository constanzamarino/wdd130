        <p> Hi! My name is Constanza Mari침o. I am from Mendoza, Argentina. My province is known for its wines and
            mountains.
            I'm studying a degree in Tourism and another in French apart from
            Web & Computer Programming.
            I have four cats that I adore with all my heart: Kitty, Alex, India and Freddy.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, drawing, listening to music and running on weekends.
            I also love learning languages, so that's why I speak English, French and
            Portuguese besides Spanish.
            I am thrilled to learn about web development and create both my own websites and other people's web pages!
            I am enjoying so far these courses, I have learned a lot and I'm looking forward to learn more.
