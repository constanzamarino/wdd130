            Argentina is a country known for its cultural, natural and historic richness. It's the
            home of tango, a famous passionate dance across the world. It's one of the first countries that come to your
            mind when you think about football since it has one of the greatest and influent players around the globe,
            Lionel Messi, and a strong consolidated football team. It also stands out because of its gastronomy,
            specially for the "asados", the "empanadas" and the "mate", typical dishes and traditional drink of great
            social value. In terms of nature, Argentina possesses unique landscapes like the region of Patagonia
            (glaciers, mountains and lakes), the Iguazu Falls (Catar치tas de Iguaz칰), the Quebrada de Humahuaca and the
            Cordillera de Los Andes. It's one of the main wine producers, particularly in Mendoza.

            Argentina is equally recognized by marvelous writers like Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cort치zar, and for its
            strong musical and folkloric tradition. Besides to all this, it is known for the spirit and passion that its
            inhabitants have for the country, and its cultural identity mixed with the europeans immigrants and natives
            ones.
